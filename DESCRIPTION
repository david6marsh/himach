Description: For supersonic aircraft, flying subsonic over land
    find the quickest route between airports. Allow for coastal buffer and 
    potentially closed regions. Uses minimal model of aircraft performance:
    focus is on time saved versus subsonic flight, rather than vertical flight
    profile.
