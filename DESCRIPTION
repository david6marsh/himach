Title: High Mach Finds Routes for Supersonic Aircraft
Version: 0.3.2
Authors@R: c(
    person("David", "Marsh", , "david6marsh@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre")),

  )
Description: For supersonic aircraft, flying subsonic over land, find the
    best route between airports. Allow for coastal buffer and potentially
    closed regions. Use a minimal model of aircraft performance: the focus
    is on time saved versus subsonic flight, rather than on vertical
    flight profile. For modelling and forecasting, not for planning your
    flight!
