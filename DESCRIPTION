Description: For supersonic aircraft, flying subsonic over land,
    find the quickest route between airports. Allow for coastal buffer and
    potentially closed regions. Uses minimal model of aircraft
    performance: focus is on time saved versus subsonic flight, rather
    than vertical flight profile. For modelling, not for planning your
    flight.
