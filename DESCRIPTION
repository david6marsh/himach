Description: For supersonic aircraft, flying subsonic over land,
    find the best route between airports. Allow for coastal buffer and
    potentially closed regions. Use a minimal model of aircraft
    performance: the focus is on time saved versus subsonic flight, rather
    than on vertical flight profile. For modelling and forecasting, not for planning your
    flight!
