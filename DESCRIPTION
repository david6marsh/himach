Title: High Mach Finds Routes for Supersonic Aircraft 
Version: 0.1.2
Authors@R: 
    c(person(given = "David",
           family = "Marsh",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "david.marsh@eurocontrol.int"),

    role = c("fnd", "cph")))
Description: For supersonic aircraft, flying subsonic over land,
    High Mach finds the best route between airports. Allows for coastal buffer and
    potentially closed regions. Uses minimal model of aircraft
    performance: focus is on time saved versus subsonic flight, rather
    than vertical flight profile. For modelling and forecasting, not for planning your
    flight!
