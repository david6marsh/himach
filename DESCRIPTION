Description: For supersonic aircraft, flying subsonic over land,
    'High Mach' finds the best route between airports. Allows for coastal buffer and
    potentially closed regions. Uses minimal model of aircraft
    performance: focus is on time saved versus subsonic flight, rather
    than vertical flight profile. For modelling and forecasting, not for planning your
    flight!
