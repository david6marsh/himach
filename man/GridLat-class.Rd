\title{A grid and lattice combination}
\description{
A \code{GridLat} keeps together a grid of points and a
lattice of links between those points.

It has 3 components:

* A character name, which isn't used much in anger but might help you remember what's gone into it.
* A dataframe containing the points of the lattice (the vertices), which each have an ID, a longitude and latitude.
* A dataframe containing the edges of the lattice, joining the points.
