# Get test data

Access 5 datasets that are used in vignettes and in testing.

## Usage

``` r
hm_get_test(item = c("coast", "buffer", "nofly", "grid", "route"))
```

## Source

<https://datafinder.stats.govt.nz/layer/104266-territorial-authority-2020-clipped-generalised/>

## Arguments

- item:

  Any one of `"coast", "buffer", "nofly", "grid", "route"`. See details.

## Value

See list above

## Details

- `"coast"`:

  A dataset containing sf::MULTIPOLYGONS for New Zealand. Simplified
  version of Stats NZ data, at 1km resolution.

- `"buffer"`:

  As `"coast"` but with an added 30km buffer to keep supersonic flight
  away from the coast.

- `"nofly"`:

  As `"buffer"`, but limited to Buller district with a 40km buffer. To
  test additional no-fly zones.

- `"grid"`:

  Latitude-longitude-based routing grid around New Zealand at 30km
  target distance, as generated by
  [`make_route_grid`](https://david6marsh.github.io/himach/reference/make_route_grid.md),
  so format is
  [GridLat](https://david6marsh.github.io/himach/reference/GridLat-class.md)

- `"route"`:

  Some very unlikely supersonic routes around New Zealand using the test
  aircraft that was given a very short range and slow subsonic cruise to
  get the example to 'work'. Includes one refuelling stop (!) in
  Wellington. \[Not for operational use!\] Returns a dataframe.

This is not the normal way to access package test data. But the usual,
direct, way fails on some machines that have some older software (a
known feature of the \`sf\` package). This is a least-ugly workaround.

## Examples

``` r
NZ_coast <- hm_get_test("coast")
```
