# himach: Find Routes for Supersonic Aircraft

For supersonic aircraft, flying subsonic over land, find the best route
between airports. Allow for coastal buffer and potentially closed
regions. Use a minimal model of aircraft performance: the focus is on
time saved versus subsonic flight, rather than on vertical flight
profile. For modelling and forecasting, not for planning your flight!
